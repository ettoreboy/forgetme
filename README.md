# Can you forget me?
A small web page that let you search for your public accounts and rate them.
<p><b>canyouforgetme</b> lets you know which public accounts, connected to your e-mail or personal name, are visible on the public web and how easy would it be to delete yourself from those account.</p>
<p>It combines the results of <a href="www.pipl.com">Pipl.com</a> and <a href="www.justdelete.me">Just Delete Me</a>
in order to grade how difficult would it be to delete your public records.
<p>At the moment, <b>canyouforgetme</b> works only with exact matches, thus, only if the e-mail and name given
matches exactly the results founded by Pipl.com. In the future, I will add the possibility to choose the exact person among possible matches.</p>
